# JavaScript-secret-message
Hi there, 

If you're viewing this, you're probably shopping around my portfolio. Maybe you're my future boss. Maybe you're a recruiter. Maybe you're a future client. Or maybe you're just a curious person. 

Whatever the case, it's lovely to meet you. 

## What is this?

Being a Data Journalist is part writer, part data visualiser, and part data-jack-of-all-trades. As part of my D3.JS skill journey, I've been learning the [fundamentals of JavaScript at Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/introduction-to-javascript)

(I already have a few [D3 projects](https://theheasman.com/how-i-used-a-market-basket-analysis-to-get-a-job-offer/) [under my belt](https://theheasman.com/data-history-of-uk-interest-rates/), and can hack my way through JavaScript, but I wanted to get the fundamentals down.)

This project was part of the JavaScript Arrays module and is intended to teach how to utilize arrays to manage data in JavaScript.

## What did you learn?

* Arrays and how they can be used to store and manipulate data.
* How to use array methods to manipulate arrays. 
* How arrays are mutable even if they're defined with the `const` keyword (pass-by-reference).


## Where can I view the code?

**[You can see my code solution here.](https://github.com/david-heasman00/javascript-secret-message/blob/main/main.js)**

## How can I speak to you?

Want to chat about a project, or a potential opportunity? I'm happy to connect [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidheasman/). Include a brief note in your connection request about why you're reaching out. 

Till later.
